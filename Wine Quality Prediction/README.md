Problem Statement

Consider there is a wine manufacturing company, and this company wants to create a new brand of wine. Assume you are a experienced data scientist, and this company wants you to find the quality of the wine, using several chemical parameters, like citric acid content, sugar content etc. 
Here, we will build a ML model which will take all these chemical parameters as input, and predict whether the quality of wine is good or not, or how good the quality is. 

Work Flow

- Gather dataset (follow supervised learning)
- Data analysis (check which features affect the quality)
- Data preprocessing (process data, so that it will be compatible for model)
- Train test split (split dataset into training and testing data)
- Feed this training data to ML model (using Random Forest Algorithm)
- Test the trained model to check accuracy by giving it new data
