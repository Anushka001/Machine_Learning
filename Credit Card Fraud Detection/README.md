Here, our Problem statement is to build a Machine Learning model, which will predict if a Credit Card Transaction is Legit or Fraud.

Work flow:
- Data collection
- Data preprocessing
- Splitting the data into train test set
- Training the model using Logistic Regression (best for binary classification)
- Evaluating the trained model using test dataset
- Feeding new data to predict if the transaction is Legit or Fraud
