Our Problem statement is to build a Machine Learning model which can recommend movies to a user based on their favourite movies, or their frequent watched movies. The recommendations can be Content based, Popularity based, or Collaborative based. 
- Content based -> based on the previous watches of the user
- Popularity based -> based on the popular movies, on the basis of content based
- Collaborative based -> based on a group of people, on their watching pattern.

Work Flow
- Data collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction
- Taking user input (their favourite movie)
- Using Cosine Similarity Algorithm to Recommend a list of movies to the user based on their input
